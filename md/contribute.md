# Contribute

Symposium is built by a community of developers exploring the best ways to collaborate with AI. We welcome contributions of all kinds!

## Join the conversation

Chat with the community on our [Zulip server](https://socratic-shell.zulipchat.com) - share ideas, ask questions, and connect with other developers working on AI collaboration tools.

## Propose new features

For major new features, we use **Requests for Dialog (RFDs)** - our version of the RFC process. RFDs are living documents that track a feature from initial design through implementation.

**Looking to contribute?** Check out the [Invited section](./rfds/invited.md) - these are RFDs where we're actively seeking contributors to take the lead.

To propose a new RFD, create a pull request adding your proposal to the [Draft section](./rfds/draft.md). Use our [RFD template](./rfds/TEMPLATE.md) to get started.

## Code contributions

Pull requests are welcome! Whether it's bug fixes, documentation improvements, or small feature additions, we appreciate all contributions.

- Browse the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/symposium-dev/symposium/)
- Check out existing [issues](https://github.com/symposium-dev/symposium/issues) 
- Read our [development setup guide](./design/implementation-overview.md)

## Get involved

The best way to contribute is to start using Symposium and share your experience. What works well? What could be better? Your feedback helps shape the future of AI collaboration tools.

Join us in building the future of human-AI collaboration!
